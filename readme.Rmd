NetCoMi (**Net**work **Co**nstruction and Comparison for **Mi**crobiome Data) 
provides functionality for constructing, analyzing, and comparing networks 
suitable for the application on microbial compositional data. 
The R package implements the workflow proposed in 

Stefanie Peschel, Christian L M&uuml;ller, Erika von Mutius, Anne-Laure 
Boulesteix, Martin Depner (2020). 
[NetCoMi: network construction and comparison for microbiome data in R](https://academic.oup.com/bib/advance-article/doi/10.1093/bib/bbaa290/6017455). 
*Briefings in Bioinformatics*, bbaa290. https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbaa290.

NetCoMi allows its users to construct, analyze, and compare microbial association or 
dissimilarity networks in a fast and reproducible manner. 
Starting with a read count matrix originating from a sequencing process, the 
pipeline includes a wide range of
existing methods for treating zeros in the data, normalization, 
computing microbial associations or dissimilarities, and sparsifying the 
resulting association/ dissimilarity matrix. These methods can be combined in a 
modular fashion to generate microbial networks.
NetCoMi can either be used for constructing, analyzing and visualizing a single 
network, or for comparing two networks in a graphical as well as a quantitative 
manner, including statistical tests. The package furthermore offers 
functionality for constructing differential networks, where only differentially 
associated taxa are connected.

Microbial associations are compared between the two experimantal settings 
'warming' and 'non-warming' using the same layout in both groups.

## Installation

```{r install, eval=FALSE}
#install.packages("devtools")

devtools::install_github("stefpeschel/NetCoMi", dependencies = TRUE,
                         repos = c("https://cloud.r-project.org/",
                                   BiocManager::repositories()))
```

If there are any errors during installation, please install the missing 
dependencies manually.

Packages that are optionally required in certain settings are not installed 
together with NetCoMi. These can be automatically installed using:

```{r install2, eval=FALSE}
installNetCoMiPacks()

# Please check:
?installNetCoMiPacks()
```

If not installed via `installNetCoMiPacks()`, the required package is installed
by the respective NetCoMi function when needed.

## Basic Usage

We use the American Gut data from [`SpiecEasi`](https://github.com/zdk123/SpiecEasi) 
package to look at some examples of how NetCoMi is applied. NetCoMi's main 
functions are `netConstruct()` for network construction, `netAnalyze()` for 
network analysis, and `netCompare()` for network comparison. 
As you will see in the following, these three functions must 
be executed in the aforementioned order. A further function is `diffnet()` for 
constructing a differential association network. `diffnet()` must be applied to 
the object returned from `netConstruct()`.

First of all, we load NetCoMi and the data from American Gut Project (provided 
by [`SpiecEasi`](https://github.com/zdk123/SpiecEasi), which is automatically 
loaded together with NetCoMi).
```{r load data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,}
library(NetCoMi)
data("amgut1.filt")
data("amgut2.filt.phy")
```

### Single network with SPRING as association measure

**Network construction and analysis**

We firstly construct a single association network using the 
[SPRING](https://github.com/GraceYoon/SPRING) approach for 
estimating associations (conditional dependence) between OTUs. 

The data are filtered within `netConstruct()` as follows:

- Only samples with a total number of reads of at least 1000 are included 
(argument `filtSamp`). 
- Only the 100 taxa with highest frequency are included (argument `filtTax`).

`measure` defines the association or dissimilarity measure, which is `"spring"` 
in our case. Additional arguments are passed to `SPRING()` via `measurePar`. 
`nlambda` and `rep.num` are set to 10 for a decreased execution time, but should 
be higher for real data.

Normalization as well as zero handling is performed internally in `SPRING()`. 
Hence, we set `normMethod` and `zeroMethod` to `"none"`.

We furthermore set `sparsMethod` to `"none"` because `SPRING` returns a sparse
network where no additional sparsification step is necessary.

We use the "signed" method for transforming associations into dissimilarities 
(argument `dissFunc`). In doing so, strongly negatively associated taxa have a 
high dissimilarity and, in turn, a low similarity, which corresponds to edge 
weights in the network plot.

The `verbose` argument is set to 3 so that all messages generated by 
`netConstruct()` as well as messages of external functions are printed.

```{r single spring}
net_single <- netConstruct(amgut1.filt,
                           filtTax = "highestFreq",
                           filtTaxPar = list(highestFreq = 100),
                           filtSamp = "totalReads",
                           filtSampPar = list(totalReads = 1000),
                           measure = "spring",
                           measurePar = list(nlambda=10, 
                                             rep.num=10),
                           normMethod = "none", 
                           zeroMethod = "none",
                           sparsMethod = "none", 
                           dissFunc = "signed",
                           verbose = 3,
                           seed = 123456)
```

**Analyzing the constructed network** 

NetCoMi's `netAnalyze()` function is used for analyzing the constructed 
network(s).

Here, `centrLCC` is set to `TRUE` meaning that centralities are calculated only 
for nodes in the largest connected component (LCC). 

Clusters are identified using greedy modularity optimization 
(by `cluster_fast_greedy()` from [`igraph`](https://igraph.org/r/) package).

Hubs are nodes with an eigenvector centrality value above the empirical 
95% quantile of all eigenvector centralities in the network (argument `hubPar`).

`weightDeg` and `normDeg` are set to `FALSE` so that the degree of a node is
simply defined as number of nodes that are adjacent to the node.

```{r single spring 2}
props_single <- netAnalyze(net_single, 
                           centrLCC = TRUE,
                           clustMethod = "cluster_fast_greedy",
                           hubPar = "eigenvector",
                           weightDeg = FALSE, normDeg = FALSE)

#?summary.microNetProps
summary(props_single, numbNodes = 5L)
```

**Visualizing the network**

We use the determined clusters as node colors and scale
the node sizes according to the node's eigenvector centrality. 

```{r helppage, eval=FALSE}
# help page
?plot.microNetProps
```

```{r single spring 3, fig.height=18, fig.width=20}
p <- plot(props_single, 
          nodeColor = "cluster", 
          nodeSize = "eigenvector",
          title1 = "Network on OTU level with SPRING associations", 
          showTitle = TRUE,
          cexTitle = 2.3)

legend(0.7, 1.1, cex = 2.2, title = "estimated association:",
       legend = c("+","-"), lty = 1, lwd = 3, col = c("#009900","red"), 
       bty = "n", horiz = TRUE)
```

Note that edge weights are (non-negative) similarities, however, the edges 
belonging to negative estimated associations are colored in red by default 
(`negDiffCol = TRUE`).

By default, a different transparency value is added to edges with an absolute 
weight below and above the `cut` value (arguments `edgeTranspLow` and 
`edgeTranspHigh`). The determined `cut` value can be read out as
follows:

```{r single spring 4}
p$q1$Arguments$cut
```

### Single network with Pearson correlation as association measure

Let's construct another network using Pearson's correlation coefficient
as association measure. The input is now a `phyloseq` object.

Since Pearson correlations may lead to compositional effects when applied to 
sequencing data, we use the clr transformation as normalization method. Zero 
treatment is necessary in this case.

A threshold of 0.3 is used as sparsification method, so that only OTUs with an
absolute correlation greater than or equal to 0.3 are connected.


```{r single pears, fig.height=18, fig.width=20}
net_single2 <- netConstruct(amgut2.filt.phy,  
                            measure = "pearson",
                            normMethod = "clr", 
                            zeroMethod = "multRepl",
                            sparsMethod = "threshold", 
                            thresh = 0.3,
                            verbose = 3)
```

Network analysis and plotting:

```{r single pears 1, fig.height=18, fig.width=20}
props_single2 <- netAnalyze(net_single2, clustMethod = "cluster_fast_greedy")

plot(props_single2, 
     nodeColor = "cluster", 
     nodeSize = "eigenvector",
     title1 = "Network on OTU level with Pearson correlations", 
     showTitle = TRUE,
     cexTitle = 2.3)

legend(0.7, 1.1, cex = 2.2, title = "estimated correlation:", 
       legend = c("+","-"), lty = 1, lwd = 3, col = c("#009900","red"), 
       bty = "n", horiz = TRUE)
```

Let's improve the visualization a bit by changing the following arguments:

- `repulsion = 0.8`: Place the nodes further apart
- `rmSingles = TRUE`: Single nodes are removed
- `labelScale = FALSE` and `cexLabels = 1.6`: All labels have equal size and are
enlarged to improve readability of small node's labels
- `nodeSizeSpread = 3` (default is 4): Node sizes are more similar if the value
is decreased. This argument (in combination with `cexNodes`) is useful to enlarge
small nodes while keeping the size of big nodes.

```{r single pears 2, fig.height=18, fig.width=20}
plot(props_single2, 
     nodeColor = "cluster", 
     nodeSize = "eigenvector",
     repulsion = 0.8,
     rmSingles = TRUE,
     labelScale = FALSE,
     cexLabels = 1.6,
     nodeSizeSpread = 3,
     cexNodes = 2,
     title1 = "Network on OTU level with Pearson correlations", 
     showTitle = TRUE,
     cexTitle = 2.3)

legend(0.7, 1.1, cex = 2.2, title = "estimated correlation:",
       legend = c("+","-"), lty = 1, lwd = 3, col = c("#009900","red"),
       bty = "n", horiz = TRUE)
```

### Single association network on genus level

We now construct a further network, where OTUs are agglomerated to genera. 

```{r single genus 1}
# Agglomerate to genus level
amgut_genus <- phyloseq::tax_glom(amgut2.filt.phy, taxrank = "Rank6")
taxtab <- amgut_genus@tax_table@.Data

# Find undefined taxa (in this data set, unknowns occur only up to Rank5)
miss_f <- which(taxtab[, "Rank5"] == "f__")
miss_g <- which(taxtab[, "Rank6"] == "g__")

# Number unspecified genera
taxtab[miss_f, "Rank5"] <- paste0("f__", 1:length(miss_f))
taxtab[miss_g, "Rank6"] <- paste0("g__", 1:length(miss_g))

# Find duplicate genera
dupl_g <- which(duplicated(taxtab[, "Rank6"]) |
                  duplicated(taxtab[, "Rank6"], fromLast = TRUE))

for(i in seq_along(taxtab)){
  # The next higher non-missing rank is assigned to unspecified genera
  if(i %in% miss_f && i %in% miss_g){
    taxtab[i, "Rank6"] <- paste0(taxtab[i, "Rank6"], "(", taxtab[i, "Rank4"], ")")
  } else if(i %in% miss_g){
    taxtab[i, "Rank6"] <- paste0(taxtab[i, "Rank6"], "(", taxtab[i, "Rank5"], ")")
  }
  
  # Family names are added to duplicate genera
  if(i %in% dupl_g){
    taxtab[i, "Rank6"] <- paste0(taxtab[i, "Rank6"], "(", taxtab[i, "Rank5"], ")")
  }
}

amgut_genus@tax_table@.Data <- taxtab
rownames(amgut_genus@otu_table@.Data) <- taxtab[, "Rank6"]

# Network construction and analysis
net_single3 <- netConstruct(amgut_genus, 
                            measure = "pearson",
                            zeroMethod = "multRepl",
                            normMethod = "clr", 
                            sparsMethod = "threshold", 
                            thresh = 0.3, 
                            verbose = 3)

props_single3 <- netAnalyze(net_single3, clustMethod = "cluster_fast_greedy")
```

**Network plots**

Modifications:

- Fruchterman-Reingold layout algorithm from `igraph` package used (passed to 
`plot` as matrix)
- Shortened labels
- Fixed node sizes, where hubs are enlarged
- Node color is gray for all nodes (transparancy is lower for hub nodes by default)

```{r single genus 2, fig.height=18, fig.width=20}
# Compute layout
graph3 <- igraph::graph_from_adjacency_matrix(net_single3$adjaMat1, weighted = TRUE)
lay_fr <- igraph::layout_with_fr(graph3)
# Note that row names of the layout matrix must match the node names
rownames(lay_fr) <- rownames(net_single3$adjaMat1)

plot(props_single3,
     layout = lay_fr,
     shortenLabels = "simple",
     labelLength = 10,
     nodeSize = "fix",
     nodeColor = "gray",
     cexNodes = 0.8,
     cexHubs = 1.1,
     cexLabels = 1.2,
     title1 = "Network on genus level with Pearson correlations", 
     showTitle = TRUE,
     cexTitle = 2.3)

legend(0.7, 1.1, cex = 2.2, title = "estimated correlation:",
       legend = c("+","-"), lty = 1, lwd = 3, col = c("#009900","red"), 
       bty = "n", horiz = TRUE)
```

Since the above visualization is obviously not optimal, we make further 
adjustments:

- This time, the Fruchterman-Reingold layout algorithm is computed within the 
plot function and thus applied to the "reduced" network without singletons
- Leading patterns "g__" are removed
- Labels are not scaled to node sizes
- Single nodes are removed
- Node sizes are scaled to the column sums of clr-transformed data
- Node colors represent the determined clusters
- Border color of hub nodes is changed from black to darkgray
- Label size of hubs is enlarged

```{r single genus 3, fig.height=18, fig.width=20}
set.seed(123456)
graph3 <- igraph::graph_from_adjacency_matrix(net_single3$adjaMat1, weighted = TRUE)
lay_fr <- igraph::layout_with_fr(graph3)
rownames(lay_fr) <- rownames(net_single3$adjaMat1)

plot(props_single3,
     layout = "layout_with_fr",
     shortenLabels = "simple",
     labelLength = 10,
     charToRm = "g__",
     labelScale = FALSE,
     rmSingles = TRUE,
     nodeSize = "clr",
     nodeColor = "cluster",
     hubBorderCol = "darkgray",
     cexNodes = 2,
     cexLabels = 1.5,
     cexHubLabels = 2,
     title1 = "Network on genus level with Pearson correlations", 
     showTitle = TRUE,
     cexTitle = 2.3)

legend(0.7, 1.1, cex = 2.2, title = "estimated correlation:",
       legend = c("+","-"), lty = 1, lwd = 3, col = c("#009900","red"), 
       bty = "n", horiz = TRUE)
```

Let's check whether the largest nodes are actually those with highest 
column sums in the matrix with normalized counts returned from `netConstruct()`.

```{r single genus 4}
sort(colSums(net_single3$normCounts1), decreasing = TRUE)[1:10]
```

In order to further improve our plot, we use the following modifications:

- This time, we choose the "spring" layout as part of `qgraph()` (the function 
is generally used for network plotting in NetCoMi)
- A repulsion value below 1 places the nodes further apart
- Labels are not shortened anymore
- Nodes (bacteria on genus level) are colored according to the respective phylum
- Edges representing positive associations are colored in blue, negative ones in
orange (just to give an example for alternative edge coloring)
- Transparency is increased for edges with high weight to improve the readability 
of node labels


```{r single genus 5, fig.height=18, fig.width=20}
# Get phyla names from the taxonomic table created before
phyla <- as.factor(gsub("p__", "", taxtab[, "Rank2"]))
names(phyla) <- taxtab[, "Rank6"]
#table(phyla)

# Define phylum colors
phylcol <- c("cyan", "blue3", "red", "lawngreen", "yellow", "deeppink")

     cexTitle = 2.3)

# Colors used in the legend should be equally transparent as in the plot
phylcol_transp <- NetCoMi:::colToTransp(phylcol, 60)

legend(-1.2, 1.2, cex = 2, pt.cex = 2.5, title = "Phylum:",

legend(0.7, 1.1, cex = 2.2, title = "estimated correlation:",
       legend = c("+","-"), lty = 1, lwd = 3, col = c("darkturquoise","orange"), 
       bty = "n", horiz = TRUE)
```



### Network comparison

Now let's look how two networks are compared using NetCoMi. 

**Network construction**

The covariate `"SEASONAL_ALLERGIES`" is used for splitting the data set into two
groups. The [`metagMisc`](https://github.com/vmikk/metagMisc) package offers a 
function for splitting phyloseq objects according to a variable. 
The two resulting phyloseq objects (we ignore the group
'None') can directly be passed to NetCoMi.

We select the 50 nodes with highest variance to get smaller networks.

```{r netcomp spring 1}
# devtools::install_github("vmikk/metagMisc")

# Split the phyloseq object into two groups
amgut_split <- metagMisc::phyloseq_sep_variable(amgut2.filt.phy, 
                                                "SEASONAL_ALLERGIES")

# Network construction
net_season <- netConstruct(data = amgut_split$no, 
                           data2 = amgut_split$yes,  
                           filtTax = "highestVar",
                           filtTaxPar = list(highestVar = 50),
                           measure = "spring",
                           measurePar = list(nlambda=10, 
                                             rep.num=10),
                           normMethod = "none", 
                           zeroMethod = "none",
                           sparsMethod = "none", 
                           dissFunc = "signed",
                           verbose = 3,
                           seed = 123456)
```

Alternatively, a group vector could be passed to `group`, according to which
the data set is split into two groups:

```{r netcomp spring 2, eval=FALSE}
# netConstruct() expects samples in rows
countMat <- t(amgut2.filt.phy@otu_table@.Data)
group_vec <- phyloseq::get_variable(amgut2.filt.phy, "SEASONAL_ALLERGIES")

# Select the two groups of interest (level "none" is excluded)
sel <- which(group_vec %in% c("no", "yes"))
group_vec <- group_vec[sel]
countMat <- countMat[sel, ]

net_season <- netConstruct(countMat, 
                           group = group_vec, 
                           filtTax = "highestVar",
                           filtTaxPar = list(highestVar = 50),
                           measure = "spring",
                           measurePar = list(nlambda=10, 
                                             rep.num=10),
                           normMethod = "none", 
                           zeroMethod = "none",
                           sparsMethod = "none", 
                           dissFunc = "signed",
                           verbose = 3,
                           seed = 123456)

```

**Network analysis** 

The object returned from `netConstruct()` containing both networks is again 
passed to `netAnalyze()`. Network properties are computed for both networks
simultaneously. 

To demonstrate further functionalities of `netAnalyze()`, we play around with 
the available arguments, even if the chosen setting might not be optimal. 

- `centrLCC = FALSE`: Centralities are calculated for all nodes (not only for the
largest connected component).
- `avDissIgnoreInf = TRUE`: Nodes with an infinite dissimilarity are ignored 
when calculating the average dissimilarity.
- `sPathNorm = FALSE`: Shortest paths are not normalized by average dissimilarity.
- `hubPar = c("degree", "between", "closeness")`: Hubs are nodes with highest
degree, betweenness, and closeness centrality at the same time.
- `lnormFit = TRUE` and `hubQuant = 0.9`: A log-normal distribution is fitted to
the centrality values to identify nodes with "highest" centrality values. 
Here, a node is identified as hub if for each of the three centrality measures, 
the node's centrality value is above the 90% quantile of the fitted log-normal 
distribution.
- The non-normalized centralities are used for all four measures.

**Note! The arguments must be set carefully, depending on the research 
questions. NetCoMi's default values are not generally preferable in all 
practical cases!**

```{r netcomp spring 3}
props_season <- netAnalyze(net_season, 
                           centrLCC = FALSE,
                           avDissIgnoreInf = TRUE,
                           sPathNorm = FALSE,
                           clustMethod = "cluster_fast_greedy",
                           hubPar = c("degree", "between", "closeness"),
                           hubQuant = 0.9,
                           lnormFit = TRUE,
                           normDeg = FALSE,
                           normBetw = FALSE,
                           normClose = FALSE,
                           normEigen = FALSE)

summary(props_season)
```

In the above setting, only one hub node (in the "Seasonal allergies" network)
has been identified. 

**Visual network comparison**

First, the layout is computed separately in both groups (qgraph's "spring" 
layout in this case).

Node sizes are scaled according to the mclr-transformed data since `SPRING` uses
the mclr transformation as normalization method.

Node colors represent clusters. Note that by default, two clusters have the same 
color in both groups if they have at least two nodes in common 
(`sameColThresh = 2`). Set `sameClustCol` to `FALSE` to get different cluster colors.

```{r netcomp spring 4, fig.height=19, fig.width=40}
plot(props_season, 
     sameLayout = FALSE, 
     nodeColor = "cluster",
     nodeSize = "mclr",
     labelScale = FALSE,
     cexNodes = 1.5, 
     cexLabels = 2.5,
     cexHubLabels = 3,
     cexTitle = 3.7,
     groupNames = c("No seasonal allergies", "Seasonal allergies"),
     hubBorderCol  = "gray40")

legend("bottom", title = "estimated association:", legend = c("+","-"), 
       col = c("#009900","red"), inset = 0.02, cex = 4, lty = 1, lwd = 4, 
       bty = "n", horiz = TRUE)
```

Using different layouts leads to a "nice-looking" network plot for each group, 
however, it is difficult to identify group differences at a glance.

Thus, we now use the same layout in both groups. In the following, the layout is
computed for group 1 (the left network) and taken over for group 2.

`rmSingles` is set to `"inboth"` because only nodes that are unconnected in both
groups can be removed if the same layout is used.


```{r netcomp spring 5, fig.height=19, fig.width=40}
plot(props_season, 
     sameLayout = TRUE, 
     layoutGroup = 1,
     rmSingles = "inboth", 
     nodeSize = "mclr", 
     labelScale = FALSE,
     cexNodes = 1.5, 
     cexLabels = 2.5,
     cexHubLabels = 3,
     cexTitle = 3.8,
     groupNames = c("No seasonal allergies", "Seasonal allergies"),
     hubBorderCol  = "gray40")

legend("bottom", title = "estimated association:", legend = c("+","-"), 
       col = c("#009900","red"), inset = 0.02, cex = 4, lty = 1, lwd = 4, 
       bty = "n", horiz = TRUE)
```

In the above plot, we can see clear differences between the groups. The OTU "322235", 
for instance, is more strongly connected in the "Seasonal allergies" group than
in the group without seasonal allergies, which is why it is a hub on the right, 
but not on the left.

Since simply taking over the layout of one group to the other usually leads to an 
"unsightly" plot for one of the groups, NetCoMi (>= 1.0.2) offers a further 
option (`layoutGroup = "union"`), where a union of both layouts is used in both 
groups.
In doing so, the nodes are placed as optimal as possible equally for both networks.

*The idea and R code for this functionality were provided by 
[Christian L. Müller](https://github.com/muellsen?tab=followers) and 
[Alice Sommer](https://www.iq.harvard.edu/people/alice-sommer)*


```{r netcomp spring 6, fig.height=19, fig.width=40}
plot(props_season, 
     sameLayout = TRUE, 
     layoutGroup = "union",
     rmSingles = "inboth", 
     nodeSize = "mclr", 
     labelScale = FALSE,
     cexNodes = 1.5, 
     cexLabels = 2.5,
     cexHubLabels = 3,
     cexTitle = 3.8,
     groupNames = c("No seasonal allergies", "Seasonal allergies"),
     hubBorderCol  = "gray40")

legend("bottom", title = "estimated association:", legend = c("+","-"), 
       col = c("#009900","red"), inset = 0.02, cex = 4, lty = 1, lwd = 4, 
       bty = "n", horiz = TRUE)
```

**Quantitative network comparison**

Since runtime is considerably increased if permutation tests are 
performed, we set the `permTest` parameter to `FALSE`. See the 
`tutorial_createAssoPerm` file for a network comparison including permutation tests.

```{r netcomp spring 7}
comp_season <- netCompare(props_season, permTest = FALSE, verbose = FALSE)

summary(comp_season, 
        groupNames = c("No allergies", "Allergies"),
        showCentr = c("degree", "between", "closeness"), 
        numbNodes = 5)
```


### Differential networks

We now build a differential association network, where two nodes are connected
if they are differentially associated between the two groups.

Due to its very short execution time, we use Pearson's correlations for 
estimating associations between OTUs.

Fisher's z-test is applied for identifying differentially correlated OTUs. 
Multiple testing adjustment is done by controlling the local false discovery rate.

Note: `sparsMethod` is set to `"none"`, just to be able to include all 
differential associations in the association network plot (see below). 
However, the differential network is always based on the estimated association 
matrices before sparsification (the `assoEst1` and `assoEst2` matrices returned 
by `netConstruct()`).

```{r diffnet 1, fig.height=15, fig.width=30}
net_season_pears <- netConstruct(data = amgut_split$no, 
                                 data2 = amgut_split$yes, 
                                 filtTax = "highestVar",
                                 filtTaxPar = list(highestVar = 50),
                                 measure = "pearson", 
                                 normMethod = "clr",
                                 sparsMethod = "none", 
                                 thresh = 0.2,
                                 verbose = 3)

# Differential network construction
diff_season <- diffnet(net_season_pears,
                       diffMethod = "fisherTest", 
                       adjust = "lfdr")

# Differential network plot
plot(diff_season, 
     cexNodes = 0.8, 
     cexLegend = 3,
     cexTitle = 4,
     mar = c(2,2,8,5),
     legendGroupnames = c("group 'no'", "group 'yes'"),
     legendPos = c(0.7,1.6))

```
In the differential network shown above, edge colors represent the direction of 
associations in the two groups. If, for instance, two OTUs are positively 
associated in group 1 and negatively associated in group 2 (such as '191541' 
and '188236'), the respective edge is colored in cyan.  

We also take a look at the corresponding associations by constructing 
association networks that include only the differentially associated OTUs.

```{r diffnet 2, fig.height=19, fig.width=40}
props_season_pears <- netAnalyze(net_season_pears, 
                                 clustMethod = "cluster_fast_greedy",
                                 weightDeg = TRUE,
                                 normDeg = FALSE)

# Identify the differentially associated OTUs
diffmat_sums <- rowSums(diff_season$diffAdjustMat)
diff_asso_names <- names(diffmat_sums[diffmat_sums > 0])

plot(props_season_pears, 
     nodeFilter = "names",
     nodeFilterPar = diff_asso_names,
     nodeColor = "gray",
     highlightHubs = FALSE,
     sameLayout = TRUE, 
     layoutGroup = "union",
     rmSingles = FALSE, 
     nodeSize = "clr",
     edgeTranspHigh = 20,
     labelScale = FALSE,
     cexNodes = 1.5, 
     cexLabels = 3,
     cexTitle = 3.8,
     groupNames = c("No seasonal allergies", "Seasonal allergies"),
     hubBorderCol  = "gray40")

legend(-0.15,-0.7, title = "estimated correlation:", legend = c("+","-"), 
       col = c("#009900","red"), inset = 0.05, cex = 4, lty = 1, lwd = 4, 
       bty = "n", horiz = TRUE)
```

We can see that the correlation between the aforementioned OTUs '191541' and 
'188236' is strongly positive in the left group and negative in the right group.


### Dissimilarity-based Networks

If a dissimilarity measure is used for network construction, nodes are subjects 
instead of OTUs. The estimated dissimilarities are transformed into similarities,
which are used as edge weights so that subjects with a similar microbial 
composition are placed close together in the network plot. 

We construct a single network using Aitchison's distance being suitable for the 
application on compositional data. 

Since the Aitchison distance is based on the clr-transformation, zeros in the 
data need to be replaced. 

The network is sparsified using the k-nearest neighbor (knn) algorithm.

```{r example13}
net_aitchison <- netConstruct(amgut1.filt,
                              measure = "aitchison",
                              zeroMethod = "multRepl",
                              sparsMethod = "knn", 
                              kNeighbor = 3,
                              verbose = 3)
```

For cluster detection, we use hierarchical clustering with average linkage. 
Internally, `k=3` is passed to [`cutree()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/dendextend/versions/1.13.4/topics/cutree) 
from `stats` package so that the tree is cut into 3 clusters.

```{r example14, fig.height=18, fig.width=20}
props_aitchison <- netAnalyze(net_aitchison,
                              clustMethod = "hierarchical",
                              clustPar = list(method = "average", k = 3),
                              hubPar = "eigenvector")

plot(props_aitchison, 
     nodeColor = "cluster", 
     nodeSize = "eigenvector",
     hubTransp = 40,
     edgeTranspLow = 60,
     charToRm = "00000",
     mar = c(1, 3, 3, 5))

# get green color with 50% transparency
green2 <- colToTransp("#009900", 40)

legend(0.4, 1.1,
       cex = 2.2,
       legend = c("high similarity (low Aitchison distance)",
                  "low similarity (high Aitchison distance)"), 
       lty = 1, 
       lwd = c(3, 1),
       col = c("darkgreen", green2),
       bty = "n")

```

In this dissimilarity-based network, hubs are interpreted as samples with a 
microbial composition similar to that of many other samples in the data set. 

### Soil microbiome example

Here is the code for reproducing the network plot shown at the beginning.

```{r example15, eval=FALSE}
data("soilrep")

soil_warm_yes <- phyloseq::subset_samples(soilrep, warmed == "yes")
soil_warm_no  <- phyloseq::subset_samples(soilrep, warmed == "no")

net_seas_p <- netConstruct(soil_warm_yes, soil_warm_no,
                           filtTax = "highestVar",
                           filtTaxPar = list(highestVar = 500),
                           zeroMethod = "pseudo",
                           normMethod = "clr",
                           measure = "pearson",
                           verbose = 0)

netprops1 <- netAnalyze(net_seas_p, clustMethod = "cluster_fast_greedy")

nclust <- as.numeric(max(names(table(netprops1$clustering$clust1))))
col <- topo.colors(nclust)

plot(netprops1, 
     sameLayout = TRUE, 
     layoutGroup = "union", 
     colorVec = col,
     borderCol = "gray40", 
     nodeSize = "degree", 
     cexNodes = 0.9, 
     nodeSizeSpread = 3, 
     edgeTranspLow = 80, 
     edgeTranspHigh = 50,
     groupNames = c("Warming", "Non-warming"), 
     showTitle = TRUE, 
     cexTitle = 2.8,
     mar = c(1,1,3,1), 
     repulsion = 0.9, 
     labels = FALSE, 
     rmSingles = "inboth",
     nodeFilter = "clustMin", 
     nodeFilterPar = 10, 
     nodeTransp = 50, 
     hubTransp = 30)
```
