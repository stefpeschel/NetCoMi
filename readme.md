NetCoMi (**Net**work **Co**nstruction and Comparison for **Mi**crobiome
Data) provides functionality for constructing, analyzing, and comparing
networks suitable for the application on microbial compositional data.
The R package implements the workflow proposed in

Stefanie Peschel, Christian L Müller, Erika von Mutius, Anne-Laure
Boulesteix, Martin Depner (2020). [NetCoMi: network construction and
comparison for microbiome data in
R](https://academic.oup.com/bib/advance-article/doi/10.1093/bib/bbaa290/6017455).
*Briefings in Bioinformatics*, bbaa290.
<https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbaa290>.

NetCoMi allows its users to construct, analyze, and compare microbial
association or dissimilarity networks in a fast and reproducible manner.
Starting with a read count matrix originating from a sequencing process,
the pipeline includes a wide range of existing methods for treating
zeros in the data, normalization, computing microbial associations or
dissimilarities, and sparsifying the resulting association/
dissimilarity matrix. These methods can be combined in a modular fashion
to generate microbial networks. NetCoMi can either be used for
constructing, analyzing and visualizing a single network, or for
comparing two networks in a graphical as well as a quantitative manner,
including statistical tests. The package furthermore offers
functionality for constructing differential networks, where only
differentially associated taxa are connected.

If there are any errors during installation, please install the missing
dependencies manually.

In particular the automatic installation of
[`SPRING`](https://github.com/GraceYoon/SPRING) and
[`SpiecEasi`](https://github.com/zdk123/SpiecEasi) (only available on
GitHub) does sometimes not work. These packages can be installed as
follows:

``` r
devtools::install_github("GraceYoon/SPRING")
devtools::install_github("zdk123/SpiecEasi")
```

Packages that are optionally required in certain settings are not
installed together with NetCoMi. These can be installed automatically
using:

``` r
installNetCoMiPacks()

# Please check:
?installNetCoMiPacks()
```

If not installed via `installNetCoMiPacks()`, the required package is
installed by the respective NetCoMi function when needed.

```

Please check the
[NEWS](https://github.com/stefpeschel/NetCoMi/blob/develop/NEWS.md)
document for features implemented on develop branch.

## Usage

We use the American Gut data from
[`SpiecEasi`](https://github.com/zdk123/SpiecEasi) package to look at
some examples of how NetCoMi is applied. NetCoMi’s main functions are
`netConstruct()` for network construction, `netAnalyze()` for network
analysis, and `netCompare()` for network comparison. As you will see in
the following, these three functions must be executed in the
aforementioned order. A further function is `diffnet()` for constructing
a differential association network. `diffnet()` must be applied to the
object returned by `netConstruct()`.

First of all, we load NetCoMi and the data from American Gut Project
(provided by [`SpiecEasi`](https://github.com/zdk123/SpiecEasi), which
is automatically loaded together with NetCoMi).

``` r
library(NetCoMi)
data("amgut1.filt")
data("amgut2.filt.phy")
```

### Network with SPRING as association measure

**Network construction and analysis**

We firstly construct a single association network using
[SPRING](https://github.com/GraceYoon/SPRING) for estimating
associations (conditional dependence) between OTUs.

The data are filtered within `netConstruct()` as follows:

- Only samples with a total number of reads of at least 1000 are
  included (argument `filtSamp`).
- Only the 50 taxa with highest frequency are included (argument
  `filtTax`).

`measure` defines the association or dissimilarity measure, which is
`"spring"` in our case. Additional arguments are passed to `SPRING()`
via `measurePar`. `nlambda` and `rep.num` are set to 10 for a decreased
execution time, but should be higher for real data.

Normalization as well as zero handling is performed internally in
`SPRING()`. Hence, we set `normMethod` and `zeroMethod` to `"none"`.

We furthermore set `sparsMethod` to `"none"` because `SPRING` returns a
sparse network where no additional sparsification step is necessary.

We use the “signed” method for transforming associations into
dissimilarities (argument `dissFunc`). In doing so, strongly negatively
associated taxa have a high dissimilarity and, in turn, a low
similarity, which corresponds to edge weights in the network plot.

The `verbose` argument is set to 3 so that all messages generated by
`netConstruct()` as well as messages of external functions are printed.

``` r
net_spring <- netConstruct(amgut1.filt,
                           filtTax = "highestFreq",
                           filtTaxPar = list(highestFreq = 50),
                           filtSamp = "totalReads",
                           filtSampPar = list(totalReads = 1000),
                           measure = "spring",
                           measurePar = list(nlambda=10, 
                                             rep.num=10),
                           normMethod = "none", 
                           zeroMethod = "none",
                           sparsMethod = "none", 
                           dissFunc = "signed",
                           verbose = 2,
                           seed = 123456)
```

    ## Done.

**Analyzing the constructed network**

NetCoMi’s `netAnalyze()` function is used for analyzing the constructed
network(s).

Here, `centrLCC` is set to `TRUE` meaning that centralities are
calculated only for nodes in the largest connected component (LCC).

Clusters are identified using greedy modularity optimization (by
`cluster_fast_greedy()` from [`igraph`](https://igraph.org/r/) package).

Hubs are nodes with an eigenvector centrality value above the empirical
95% quantile of all eigenvector centralities in the network (argument
`hubPar`).

`weightDeg` and `normDeg` are set to `FALSE` so that the degree of a
node is simply defined as number of nodes that are adjacent to the node.

By default, a heatmap of the Graphlet Correlation Matrix (GCM) is
returned (with graphlet correlations in the upper triangle and
significance codes resulting from Student’s t-test in the lower
triangle). See `?calcGCM` and `?testGCM` for details.

``` r
props_spring <- netAnalyze(net_spring, 
                           centrLCC = TRUE,
                           clustMethod = "cluster_fast_greedy",
                           hubPar = "eigenvector",
                           weightDeg = FALSE, normDeg = FALSE)
```

**Plotting the GCM heatmap manually**

``` r
plotHeat(mat = props_spring$graphletLCC$gcm1,
         pmat = props_spring$graphletLCC$pAdjust1,
         type = "mixed",
         title = "GCM", 
         colorLim = c(-1, 1),
         mar = c(2, 0, 2, 0))

# Add rectangles highlighting the four types of orbits
graphics::rect(xleft   = c( 0.5,  1.5, 4.5,  7.5),
               ybottom = c(11.5,  7.5, 4.5,  0.5),
               xright  = c( 1.5,  4.5, 7.5, 11.5),
               ytop    = c(10.5, 10.5, 7.5,  4.5),
               lwd = 2, xpd = NA)

text(6, -0.2, xpd = NA, 
     "Significance codes:  ***: 0.001;  **: 0.01;  *: 0.05")
```

![](man/figures/readme/single_spring_heat-1.png)<!-- -->

**Visualizing the network**

We use the determined clusters as node colors and scale the node sizes
according to the node’s eigenvector centrality.

``` r
# help page
?plot.microNetProps
```

``` r
p <- plot(props_spring, 
          nodeColor = "cluster", 
          nodeSize = "eigenvector",
          title1 = "Network on OTU level with SPRING associations", 
          showTitle = TRUE,
          cexTitle = 2.3)

legend(0.7, 1.1, cex = 2.2, title = "estimated association:",
       legend = c("+","-"), lty = 1, lwd = 3, col = c("#009900","red"), 
       bty = "n", horiz = TRUE)
```

![](man/figures/readme/single_spring_3-1.png)<!-- -->

Note that edge weights are (non-negative) similarities, however, the
edges belonging to negative estimated associations are colored in red by
default (`negDiffCol = TRUE`).

By default, a different transparency value is added to edges with an
absolute weight below and above the `cut` value (arguments
`edgeTranspLow` and `edgeTranspHigh`). The determined `cut` value can be
read out as follows:

``` r
p$q1$Arguments$cut
```

    ##      75% 
    ## 0.337099

### Network with Pearson correlation as association measure

Let’s construct another network using Pearson’s correlation coefficient
as association measure. The input is now a `phyloseq` object.

Since Pearson correlations may lead to compositional effects when
applied to sequencing data, we use the clr transformation as
normalization method. Zero treatment is necessary in this case.

A threshold of 0.3 is used as sparsification method, so that only OTUs
with an absolute correlation greater than or equal to 0.3 are connected.

``` r
net_pears <- netConstruct(amgut2.filt.phy,  
                          measure = "pearson",
                          normMethod = "clr",
                          zeroMethod = "multRepl",
                          sparsMethod = "threshold",
                          thresh = 0.3,
                          verbose = 3)
```

    ## Checking input arguments ... Done.
    ## 2 rows with zero sum removed.
    ## 138 taxa and 294 samples remaining.
    ## 
    ## Zero treatment:
    ## Execute multRepl() ... Done.
    ## 
    ## Normalization:
    ## Execute clr(){SpiecEasi} ... Done.
    ## 
    ## Calculate 'pearson' associations ... Done.
    ## 
    ## Sparsify associations via 'threshold' ... Done.

Network analysis and plotting:

``` r
props_pears <- netAnalyze(net_pears, 
                          clustMethod = "cluster_fast_greedy")
```

![](man/figures/readme/single_pears_2-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
plot(props_pears, 
     nodeColor = "cluster", 
     nodeSize = "eigenvector",
     title1 = "Network on OTU level with Pearson correlations", 
     showTitle = TRUE,
     cexTitle = 2.3)

legend(0.7, 1.1, cex = 2.2, title = "estimated correlation:", 
       legend = c("+","-"), lty = 1, lwd = 3, col = c("#009900","red"), 
       bty = "n", horiz = TRUE)
```

![](man/figures/readme/single_pears_3-1.png)<!-- -->

Let’s improve the visualization by changing the following arguments:

- `repulsion = 0.8`: Place the nodes further apart.
- `rmSingles = TRUE`: Single nodes are removed.
- `labelScale = FALSE` and `cexLabels = 1.6`: All labels have equal size
  and are enlarged to improve readability of small node’s labels.
- `nodeSizeSpread = 3` (default is 4): Node sizes are more similar if
  the value is decreased. This argument (in combination with `cexNodes`)
  is useful to enlarge small nodes while keeping the size of big nodes.
- `hubBorderCol = "darkgray"`: Change border color for a better
  readability of the node labels.

``` r
plot(props_pears, 
     nodeColor = "cluster", 
     nodeSize = "eigenvector",
     repulsion = 0.8,
     rmSingles = TRUE,
     labelScale = FALSE,
     cexLabels = 1.6,
     nodeSizeSpread = 3,
     cexNodes = 2,
     hubBorderCol = "darkgray",
     title1 = "Network on OTU level with Pearson correlations", 
     showTitle = TRUE,
     cexTitle = 2.3)

legend(0.7, 1.1, cex = 2.2, title = "estimated correlation:",
       legend = c("+","-"), lty = 1, lwd = 3, col = c("#009900","red"),

**Edge filtering**

The network can be sparsified further using the arguments `edgeFilter`
(edges are filtered before the layout is computed) and `edgeInvisFilter`
(edges are removed after the layout is computed and thus just made
“invisible”).

``` r
plot(props_pears,
     edgeInvisFilter = "threshold",
     edgeInvisPar = 0.4,
     nodeColor = "cluster", 
     nodeSize = "eigenvector",
     repulsion = 0.8,
     rmSingles = TRUE,
     labelScale = FALSE,
     cexLabels = 1.6,
     nodeSizeSpread = 3,
     cexNodes = 2,
     hubBorderCol = "darkgray",
     title1 = "Network on OTU level with Pearson correlations", 
     showTitle = TRUE,
     cexTitle = 2.3)

legend(0.7, 1.1, cex = 2.2, title = "estimated correlation:",
       legend = c("+","-"), lty = 1, lwd = 3, col = c("#009900","red"),
       bty = "n", horiz = TRUE)
```

### Using the “unsigned” transformation

In the above network, the “signed” transformation was used to transform
the estimated associations into dissimilarities. This leads to a network
where strongly positive correlated taxa have a high edge weight (1 if
the correlation equals 1) and strongly negative correlated taxa have a
low edge weight (0 if the correlation equals -1).

We now use the “unsigned” transformation so that the edge weight between
strongly correlated taxa is high, no matter of the sign. Hence, a
correlation of -1 and 1 would lead to an edge weight of 1.

**Network construction**

We can pass the network object from before to `netConstruct()` to save
runtime.

``` r
net_pears_unsigned <- netConstruct(data = net_pears$assoEst1,
                                   dataType = "correlation", 
                                   sparsMethod = "threshold",
                                   thresh = 0.3,
                                   dissFunc = "unsigned",
                                   verbose = 3)
```

    ## Checking input arguments ... Done.
    ## 
    ## Sparsify associations via 'threshold' ... Done.

**Estimated correlations and adjacency values**

The following histograms demonstrate how the estimated correlations are
transformed into adjacencies (= sparsified similarities for weighted
networks).

Sparsified estimated correlations:

``` r
hist(net_pears$assoMat1, 100, xlim = c(-1, 1), ylim = c(0, 400),
     xlab = "Estimated correlation", 
     main = "Estimated correlations after sparsification")
```

![](man/figures/readme/single_pears_hist_1-1.png)<!-- -->

Adjacency values computed using the “signed” transformation (values
different from 0 and 1 will be edges in the network):

``` r
hist(net_pears$adjaMat1, 100, ylim = c(0, 400),
     xlab = "Adjacency values", 
     main = "Transformed adjacencies (using the \"signed\" method)")
```

![](man/figures/readme/single_pears_hist_2-1.png)<!-- -->

Adjacency values computed using the “unsigned” transformation:

``` r
hist(net_pears_unsigned$adjaMat1, 100, ylim = c(0, 400),
     xlab = "Adjacency values", 
     main = "Transformed adjacencies (using the \"unsigned\" method)")
```

![](man/figures/readme/single_pears_hist_3-1.png)<!-- -->

**Network analysis and plotting**

``` r
props_pears_unsigned <- netAnalyze(net_pears_unsigned, 
                                   clustMethod = "cluster_fast_greedy",
                                   gcmHeat = FALSE)
```

``` r
plot(props_pears_unsigned, 
     nodeColor = "cluster", 
     nodeSize = "eigenvector",
     repulsion = 0.9,
     rmSingles = TRUE,
     labelScale = FALSE,
     cexLabels = 1.6,
     nodeSizeSpread = 3,
     cexNodes = 2,
     hubBorderCol = "darkgray",
     title1 = "Network with Pearson correlations and \"unsigned\" transformation", 
     showTitle = TRUE,
     cexTitle = 2.3)

legend(0.7, 1.1, cex = 2.2, title = "estimated correlation:",
       legend = c("+","-"), lty = 1, lwd = 3, col = c("#009900","red"),
       bty = "n", horiz = TRUE)
```

![](man/figures/readme/single_pears_unsigned_4-1.png)<!-- -->

While with the “signed” transformation, positive correlated taxa are
likely to belong to the same cluster, with the “unsigned” transformation
clusters contain strongly positive and negative correlated taxa.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Network on genus level

We now construct a further network, where OTUs are agglomerated to
genera.

``` r
library(phyloseq)
data("amgut2.filt.phy")

# Agglomerate to genus level
amgut_genus <- tax_glom(amgut2.filt.phy, taxrank = "Rank6")

# Taxonomic table
taxtab <- as(tax_table(amgut_genus), "matrix")

# Rename taxonomic table and make Rank6 (genus) unique
amgut_genus_renamed <- renameTaxa(amgut_genus, 
                                  pat = "<name>", 
                                  substPat = "<name>_<subst_name>(<subst_R>)",
                                  numDupli = "Rank6")
```

    ## Column 7 contains NAs only and is ignored.

``` r
# Network construction and analysis
net_genus <- netConstruct(amgut_genus_renamed,
                          taxRank = "Rank6",
                          measure = "pearson",
                          zeroMethod = "multRepl",
                          normMethod = "clr",
                          sparsMethod = "threshold",
                          thresh = 0.3,
                          verbose = 3)
```

    ## Checking input arguments ...

    ## Done.

    ## 2 rows with zero sum removed.

    ## 43 taxa and 294 samples remaining.

    ## 
    ## Zero treatment:

    ## Execute multRepl() ... Done.
    ## 
    ## Normalization:
    ## Execute clr(){SpiecEasi} ... Done.
    ## 
    ## Calculate 'pearson' associations ... Done.
    ## 
    ## Sparsify associations via 'threshold' ... Done.

``` r
props_genus <- netAnalyze(net_genus, clustMethod = "cluster_fast_greedy")
```

![](man/figures/readme/single_genus_1-1.png)<!-- -->

**Network plots**

Modifications:

- Fruchterman-Reingold layout algorithm from `igraph` package used
  (passed to `plot` as matrix)
- Shortened labels (using the “intelligent” method, which avoids
  duplicates)
- Fixed node sizes, where hubs are enlarged
- Node color is gray for all nodes (transparancy is lower for hub nodes
  by default)

``` r
# Compute layout
graph3 <- igraph::graph_from_adjacency_matrix(net_genus$adjaMat1, 
                                              weighted = TRUE)
set.seed(123456)
lay_fr <- igraph::layout_with_fr(graph3)

# Row names of the layout matrix must match the node names
rownames(lay_fr) <- rownames(net_genus$adjaMat1)

plot(props_genus,
     layout = lay_fr,
     shortenLabels = "intelligent",
     labelLength = 10,
     labelPattern = c(5, "'", 3, "'", 3),
     nodeSize = "fix",
     nodeColor = "gray",
     cexNodes = 0.8,
     cexHubs = 1.1,
     cexLabels = 1.2,
     title1 = "Network on genus level with Pearson correlations", 
     showTitle = TRUE,
     cexTitle = 2.3)

legend(0.7, 1.1, cex = 2.2, title = "estimated correlation:",
       legend = c("+","-"), lty = 1, lwd = 3, col = c("#009900","red"), 
       bty = "n", horiz = TRUE)
```

![](man/figures/readme/single_genus_2-1.png)<!-- -->

Since the above visualization is obviously not optimal, we make further
adjustments:

- This time, the Fruchterman-Reingold layout algorithm is computed
  within the plot function and thus applied to the “reduced” network
  without singletons
- Labels are not scaled to node sizes
- Single nodes are removed
- Node sizes are scaled to the column sums of clr-transformed data
- Node colors represent the determined clusters
- Border color of hub nodes is changed from black to darkgray
- Label size of hubs is enlarged

``` r
set.seed(123456)

plot(props_genus,
     layout = "layout_with_fr",
     shortenLabels = "intelligent",
     labelLength = 10,
     labelPattern = c(5, "'", 3, "'", 3),
     labelScale = FALSE,
     rmSingles = TRUE,
     nodeSize = "clr",
     nodeColor = "cluster",
     hubBorderCol = "darkgray",
     cexNodes = 2,
     cexLabels = 1.5,
     cexHubLabels = 2,
     title1 = "Network on genus level with Pearson correlations", 
     showTitle = TRUE,
     cexTitle = 2.3)

legend(0.7, 1.1, cex = 2.2, title = "estimated correlation:",
       legend = c("+","-"), lty = 1, lwd = 3, col = c("#009900","red"), 
       bty = "n", horiz = TRUE)
```

![](man/figures/readme/single_genus_3-1.png)<!-- -->

Let’s check whether the largest nodes are actually those with highest
column sums in the matrix with normalized counts returned by
`netConstruct()`.

``` r
sort(colSums(net_genus$normCounts1), decreasing = TRUE)[1:10]
```

    ##             Bacteroides              Klebsiella        Faecalibacterium 
    ##               1200.7971               1137.4928                708.0877 
    ##      5_Clostridiales(O)    2_Ruminococcaceae(F)    3_Lachnospiraceae(F) 
    ##                549.2647                502.1889                493.7558 
    ## 6_Enterobacteriaceae(F)               Roseburia         Parabacteroides 
    ##                363.3841                333.8737                328.0495 
    ##             Coprococcus 
    ##                274.4082

In order to further improve our plot, we use the following
modifications:

- This time, we choose the “spring” layout as part of `qgraph()` (the
  function is generally used for network plotting in NetCoMi)
- A repulsion value below 1 places the nodes further apart
- Labels are not shortened anymore
- Nodes (bacteria on genus level) are colored according to the
  respective phylum
- Edges representing positive associations are colored in blue, negative
  ones in orange (just to give an example for alternative edge coloring)
- Transparency is increased for edges with high weight to improve the
  readability of node labels

``` r
# Get phyla names
taxtab <- as(tax_table(amgut_genus_renamed), "matrix")
phyla <- as.factor(gsub("p__", "", taxtab[, "Rank2"]))
names(phyla) <- taxtab[, "Rank6"]
#table(phyla)

# Define phylum colors
phylcol <- c("cyan", "blue3", "red", "lawngreen", "yellow", "deeppink")

plot(props_genus,
     layout = "spring",
     repulsion = 0.84,
     shortenLabels = "none",
     charToRm = "g__",
     labelScale = FALSE,
     rmSingles = TRUE,
     nodeSize = "clr",
     nodeSizeSpread = 4,
     nodeColor = "feature", 
     featVecCol = phyla, 
     colorVec =  phylcol,
     posCol = "darkturquoise", 
     negCol = "orange",
     edgeTranspLow = 0,
     edgeTranspHigh = 40,
     cexNodes = 2,
     cexLabels = 2,
     cexHubLabels = 2.5,
     title1 = "Network on genus level with Pearson correlations", 
     showTitle = TRUE,
     cexTitle = 2.3)

# Colors used in the legend should be equally transparent as in the plot
phylcol_transp <- colToTransp(phylcol, 60)

legend(-1.2, 1.2, cex = 2, pt.cex = 2.5, title = "Phylum:", 
       legend=levels(phyla), col = phylcol_transp, bty = "n", pch = 16) 

legend(0.7, 1.1, cex = 2.2, title = "estimated correlation:",
       legend = c("+","-"), lty = 1, lwd = 3, col = c("darkturquoise","orange"),

### Using an association matrix as input

The QMP data set provided by the `SPRING` package is used to demonstrate
how NetCoMi is used to analyze a precomputed network (given as
association matrix).

The data set contains quantitative count data (true absolute values),
which SPRING can deal with. See `?QMP` for details.

`nlambda` and `rep.num` are set to 10 for a decreased execution time,
but should be higher for real data.

``` r
library(SPRING)

# Load the QMP data set
data("QMP") 

# Run SPRING for association estimation
fit_spring <- SPRING(QMP, 
                     quantitative = TRUE, 
                     lambdaseq = "data-specific",
                     nlambda = 10, 
                     rep.num = 10,
                     seed = 123456, 
                     ncores = 1,
                     verbose = FALSE)

# Optimal lambda
opt.K <- fit_spring$output$stars$opt.index
    
# Association matrix
assoMat <- as.matrix(SpiecEasi::symBeta(fit_spring$output$est$beta[[opt.K]],
                                        mode = "ave"))
rownames(assoMat) <- colnames(assoMat) <- colnames(QMP)
```

The association matrix is now passed to `netConstruct` to start the
usual NetCoMi workflow. Note that the `dataType` argument must be set
appropriately.

``` r
# Network construction and analysis
net_asso <- netConstruct(data = assoMat,
                         dataType = "condDependence",
                         sparsMethod = "none",
                         verbose = 0)

props_asso <- netAnalyze(net_asso, clustMethod = "hierarchical")
```

![](man/figures/readme/association_input_2-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
plot(props_asso,
     layout = "spring",
     repulsion = 1.2,
     shortenLabels = "none",

     nodeSize = "eigenvector",
     nodeSizeSpread = 2,
     nodeColor = "cluster",
     hubBorderCol = "gray60",
     cexNodes = 1.8,

       legend = c("+","-"), lty = 1, lwd = 3, col = c("#009900","red"), 
       bty = "n", horiz = TRUE)
```

### Network comparison

Now let’s look how NetCoMi is used to compare two networks.

**Network construction**

The data set is split by `"SEASONAL_ALLERGIES"` leading to two subsets
of samples (with and without seasonal allergies). We ignore the “None”
group.

``` r
# Split the phyloseq object into two groups
amgut_season_yes <- phyloseq::subset_samples(amgut2.filt.phy, 
                                             SEASONAL_ALLERGIES == "yes")
amgut_season_no <- phyloseq::subset_samples(amgut2.filt.phy, 
                                            SEASONAL_ALLERGIES == "no")

amgut_season_yes
```

    ## phyloseq-class experiment-level object
    ## otu_table()   OTU Table:         [ 138 taxa and 121 samples ]
    ## sample_data() Sample Data:       [ 121 samples by 166 sample variables ]
    ## tax_table()   Taxonomy Table:    [ 138 taxa by 7 taxonomic ranks ]

``` r
amgut_season_no
```

    ## phyloseq-class experiment-level object
    ## otu_table()   OTU Table:         [ 138 taxa and 163 samples ]
    ## sample_data() Sample Data:       [ 163 samples by 166 sample variables ]
    ## tax_table()   Taxonomy Table:    [ 138 taxa by 7 taxonomic ranks ]

The 50 nodes with highest variance are selected for network construction
to get smaller networks.

We filter the 121 samples (sample size of the smaller group) with
highest frequency to make the sample sizes equal and thus ensure
comparability.

``` r
n_yes <- phyloseq::nsamples(amgut_season_yes)

# Network construction
net_season <- netConstruct(data = amgut_season_no, 
                           data2 = amgut_season_yes,  
                           filtTax = "highestVar",
                           filtTaxPar = list(highestVar = 50),
                           filtSamp = "highestFreq",
                           filtSampPar = list(highestFreq = n_yes),
                           measure = "spring",
                           measurePar = list(nlambda=10, 
                                             rep.num=10),
                           normMethod = "none", 
                           zeroMethod = "none",
                           sparsMethod = "none", 
                           dissFunc = "signed",
                           verbose = 2,
                           seed = 123456)
```

    ## Checking input arguments ... Done.
    ## Data filtering ...
    ## 42 samples removed in data set 1.
    ## 0 samples removed in data set 2.
    ## 96 taxa removed in each data set.
    ## 1 rows with zero sum removed in group 2.
    ## 42 taxa and 121 samples remaining in group 1.
    ## 42 taxa and 120 samples remaining in group 2.
    ## 
    ## Calculate 'spring' associations ... Done.
    ## 
    ## Calculate associations in group 2 ... Done.

Alternatively, a group vector could be passed to `group`, according to
which the data set is split into two groups:

``` r
# Get count table
countMat <- phyloseq::otu_table(amgut2.filt.phy)

# netConstruct() expects samples in rows
countMat <- t(as(countMat, "matrix"))

group_vec <- phyloseq::get_variable(amgut2.filt.phy, "SEASONAL_ALLERGIES")

# Select the two groups of interest (level "none" is excluded)
sel <- which(group_vec %in% c("no", "yes"))
group_vec <- group_vec[sel]
countMat <- countMat[sel, ]

net_season <- netConstruct(countMat, 
                           group = group_vec, 
                           filtTax = "highestVar",
                           filtTaxPar = list(highestVar = 50),
                           filtSamp = "highestFreq",
                           filtSampPar = list(highestFreq = n_yes),
                           measure = "spring",
                           measurePar = list(nlambda=10, 
                                             rep.num=10),
                           normMethod = "none", 
                           zeroMethod = "none",
                           sparsMethod = "none", 
                           dissFunc = "signed",
                           verbose = 3,
                           seed = 123456)
```

**Network analysis**

The object returned by `netConstruct()` containing both networks is
again passed to `netAnalyze()`. Network properties are computed for both
networks simultaneously.

To demonstrate further functionalities of `netAnalyze()`, we play around
with the available arguments, even if the chosen setting might not be
optimal.

- `centrLCC = FALSE`: Centralities are calculated for all nodes (not
  only for the largest connected component).
- `avDissIgnoreInf = TRUE`: Nodes with an infinite dissimilarity are
  ignored when calculating the average dissimilarity.
- `sPathNorm = FALSE`: Shortest paths are not normalized by average
  dissimilarity.
- `hubPar = c("degree", "eigenvector")`: Hubs are nodes with highest
  degree and eigenvector centrality at the same time.
- `lnormFit = TRUE` and `hubQuant = 0.9`: A log-normal distribution is
  fitted to the centrality values to identify nodes with “highest”
  centrality values. Here, a node is identified as hub if for each of
  the three centrality measures, the node’s centrality value is above
  the 90% quantile of the fitted log-normal distribution.
- The non-normalized centralities are used for all four measures.

**Note! The arguments must be set carefully, depending on the research
questions. NetCoMi’s default values are not generally preferable in all
practical cases!**

**Visual network comparison**

First, the layout is computed separately in both groups (qgraph’s
“spring” layout in this case).

Node sizes are scaled according to the mclr-transformed data since
`SPRING` uses the mclr transformation as normalization method.

Node colors represent clusters. Note that by default, two clusters have
the same color in both groups if they have at least two nodes in common
(`sameColThresh = 2`). Set `sameClustCol` to `FALSE` to get different
cluster colors.

``` r
plot(props_season, 
     sameLayout = FALSE, 
     nodeColor = "cluster",
     nodeSize = "mclr",
     labelScale = FALSE,
     cexNodes = 1.5, 
     cexLabels = 2.5,
     cexHubLabels = 3,
     cexTitle = 3.7,
     groupNames = c("No seasonal allergies", "Seasonal allergies"),
     hubBorderCol  = "gray40")

legend("bottom", title = "estimated association:", legend = c("+","-"), 
       col = c("#009900","red"), inset = 0.02, cex = 4, lty = 1, lwd = 4, 
       bty = "n", horiz = TRUE)
```

![](man/figures/readme/netcomp_spring_4-1.png)<!-- -->

Using different layouts leads to a “nice-looking” network plot for each
group, however, it is difficult to identify group differences at first
glance.

Thus, we now use the same layout in both groups. In the following, the
layout is computed for group 1 (the left network) and taken over for
group 2.

`rmSingles` is set to `"inboth"` because only nodes that are unconnected
in both groups can be removed if the same layout is used.

``` r
plot(props_season, 
     sameLayout = TRUE, 
     layoutGroup = 1,
     rmSingles = "inboth", 
     nodeSize = "mclr", 
     labelScale = FALSE,
     cexNodes = 1.5, 
     cexLabels = 2.5,
     cexHubLabels = 3,
     cexTitle = 3.8,
     groupNames = c("No seasonal allergies", "Seasonal allergies"),
     hubBorderCol  = "gray40")

legend("bottom", title = "estimated association:", legend = c("+","-"), 
       col = c("#009900","red"), inset = 0.02, cex = 4, lty = 1, lwd = 4, 
       bty = "n", horiz = TRUE)
```

![](man/figures/readme/netcomp_spring_5-1.png)<!-- -->

In the above plot, we can see clear differences between the groups. The
OTU “322235”, for instance, is more strongly connected in the “Seasonal
allergies” group than in the group without seasonal allergies, which is
why it is a hub on the right, but not on the left.

However, if the layout of one group is simply taken over to the other,
one of the networks (here the “seasonal allergies” group) is usually not
that nice-looking due to the long edges. Therefore, NetCoMi (\>= 1.0.2)
offers a further option (`layoutGroup = "union"`), where a union of the
two layouts is used in both groups. In doing so, the nodes are placed as
optimal as possible equally for both networks.

*The idea and R code for this functionality were provided by [Christian
L. Müller](https://github.com/muellsen?tab=followers) and [Alice
Sommer](https://www.iq.harvard.edu/people/alice-sommer)*

``` r
plot(props_season, 
     sameLayout = TRUE, 
     repulsion = 0.95,
     layoutGroup = "union",
     rmSingles = "inboth", 
     nodeSize = "mclr", 
     labelScale = FALSE,
     cexNodes = 1.5, 
     cexLabels = 2.5,
     cexHubLabels = 3,
     cexTitle = 3.8,
     groupNames = c("No seasonal allergies", "Seasonal allergies"),
     hubBorderCol  = "gray40")

legend("bottom", title = "estimated association:", legend = c("+","-"), 
       col = c("#009900","red"), inset = 0.02, cex = 4, lty = 1, lwd = 4, 
       bty = "n", horiz = TRUE)
```

**Quantitative network comparison**

Since runtime is considerably increased if permutation tests are
performed, we set the `permTest` parameter to `FALSE`. See the
`tutorial_createAssoPerm` file for a network comparison including
permutation tests.

Since permutation tests are still conducted for the Adjusted Rand Index,
a seed should be set for reproducibility.

``` r
comp_season <- netCompare(props_season, 
                          permTest = FALSE, 
                          verbose = FALSE,
                          seed = 123456)

summary(comp_season, 
        groupNames = c("No allergies", "Allergies"),
        showCentr = c("degree", "between", "closeness"), 
        numbNodes = 5)
```

### Differential networks

We now build a differential association network, where two nodes are
connected if they are differentially associated between the two groups.

Due to its very short execution time, we use Pearson’s correlations for
estimating associations between OTUs.

Fisher’s z-test is applied for identifying differentially correlated
OTUs. Multiple testing adjustment is done by controlling the local false
discovery rate.

Note: `sparsMethod` is set to `"none"`, just to be able to include all
differential associations in the association network plot (see below).
However, the differential network is always based on the estimated
association matrices before sparsification (the `assoEst1` and
`assoEst2` matrices returned by `netConstruct()`).

``` r
net_season_pears <- netConstruct(data = amgut_season_no, 
                                 data2 = amgut_season_yes, 
                                 filtTax = "highestVar",
                                 filtTaxPar = list(highestVar = 50),
                                 measure = "pearson", 
                                 normMethod = "clr",

network shown above, edge colors represent the direction of associations
in the two groups. If, for instance, two OTUs are positively associated
in group 1 and negatively associated in group 2 (such as ‘191541’ and
‘188236’), the respective edge is colored in cyan.

We also take a look at the corresponding associations by constructing
association networks that include only the differentially associated
OTUs.

We can see that the correlation between the aforementioned OTUs ‘191541’
and ‘188236’ is strongly positive in the left group and negative in the
right group.

### Dissimilarity-based Networks

If a dissimilarity measure is used for network construction, nodes are
subjects instead of OTUs. The estimated dissimilarities are transformed
into similarities, which are used as edge weights so that subjects with
a similar microbial composition are placed close together in the network
plot.

We construct a single network using Aitchison’s distance being suitable
for the application on compositional data.

Since the Aitchison distance is based on the clr-transformation, zeros
in the data need to be replaced.

The network is sparsified using the k-nearest neighbor (knn) algorithm.

``` r
net_diss <- netConstruct(amgut1.filt,
                         measure = "aitchison",
                         zeroMethod = "multRepl",
                         sparsMethod = "knn",
                         kNeighbor = 3,
                         verbose = 3)
```

    ## Checking input arguments ... Done.
    ## Infos about changed arguments:

    ## 127 taxa and 289 samples remaining.

    ## Zero treatment:
    ## Execute multRepl() ... Done.
    ## 
    ## Normalization:
    ## Counts normalized by total sum scaling.

    ## Done.

For cluster detection, we use hierarchical clustering with average
linkage. Internally, `k=3` is passed to
[`cutree()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/dendextend/versions/1.13.4/topics/cutree)
from `stats` package so that the tree is cut into 3 clusters.

``` r
props_diss <- netAnalyze(net_diss,
                         clustMethod = "hierarchical",
                         clustPar = list(method = "average", k = 3),
                         hubPar = "eigenvector")
```

![](man/figures/readme/example14-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r

     nodeColor = "cluster",

     hubTransp = 40,

     charToRm = "00000",
     shortenLabels = "simple",
     labelLength = 6,
     mar = c(1, 3, 3, 5))

# get green color with 50% transparency
green2 <- colToTransp("#009900", 40)

legend(0.4, 1.1,
       cex = 2.2,
       legend = c("high similarity (low Aitchison distance)",

In this dissimilarity-based network, hubs are interpreted as samples
with a microbial composition similar to that of many other samples in
the data set.
