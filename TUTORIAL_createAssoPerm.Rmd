## Tutorial: How to use createAssoPerm() <img src="man/figures/NetCoMi_logo_800x400_300dpi.png" align="right" width="200" />

This tutorial is meant to demonstrate the options for storing and reloading 
count tables, association matrices and network properties of the permuted data 
if **permutation tests** are performed with `netCompare()` or `diffnet()`.

NetCoMi (>=1.0.2) includes the function `createAssoPerm()` for creating either 
only a matrix with permuted group labels or storing count tables and association 
matrices of the permuted data. The stored files can be passed to 
`netCompare()` and `diffnet()` so that users can repeatedly run these two
functions with varying arguments, without the need to recompute the associations
each time.
`createAssoPerm()` additionally enables to compute the permutation associations 
block-wise (for a subset of permutations) and store them in separate files. 
These files can then be combined to one large matrix (with all permutations) 
and passed to `netCompare()` or `diffnet()`.

The tutorial furthermore explains NetCoMi's ability to handle **matched data sets**.

#### Network construction and analysis

We use data from the American Gut Project and conduct a network comparison 
between subjects with and without lactose intolerance. 
To demonstrate NetCoMi's functionality for matched data, we build 
a "fake" 1:2 matched data set, where each two samples of the `LACTOSE = "no"` 
group are assigned to one sample of the `LACTOSE = "yes"` group.
We use a subset of 150 samples, leading to 50 samples in group "yes" and 100 
samples in group "no".

# Load American Gut Data (from SpiecEasi package)

       bty = "n", horiz = TRUE)
```

#### Network comparison via the "classical way"

We conduct a network comparison with permutation tests to examine whether group 
differences are significant. In order to reduce the execution time, only 100 
permutations are used. For real data sets, the number of permutations should be 
at least 1000 to get reliable results.

The matrices with estimated associations for the permuted data are stored in an 
external file (in the current working directory) named `"assoPerm_comp"`.

```{r netcomp 1}
# Network comparison
comp_amgut_orig <- netCompare(props_amgut, permTest = TRUE, nPerm = 100, 
                          storeAssoPerm = TRUE,
                          fileStoreAssoPerm = "assoPerm_comp",
                          storeCountsPerm = FALSE, 
                          seed = 123456)

summary(comp_amgut_orig)
```

The network comparison is repeated, but this time, the stored permutation 
associations are loaded by `netCompare()`. This option might be useful to 
rerun the function with alternative multiple testing adjustment, without the 
need of re-estimating all associations.

```{r netcomp 2}
# Network comparison
comp_amgut1 <- netCompare(props_amgut, permTest = TRUE, nPerm = 100, 
                          fileLoadAssoPerm = "assoPerm_comp",
                          storeCountsPerm = FALSE, 
                          seed = 123456)

# Check whether the second comparison leads to equal results
all.equal(comp_amgut_orig$properties, comp_amgut1$properties)
```

The stored permutation associations can also be passed to `diffnet()` to 
construct a differential network. 

```{r diffnet, error=TRUE}
# Construct differential network
diffnet_amgut <- diffnet(net_amgut, diffMethod = "permute", nPerm = 100, 
                          fileLoadAssoPerm = "assoPerm_comp",
                          storeCountsPerm = FALSE)

plot(diffnet_amgut)
```

As expected for a number of permutations of only 100, there are no differential 
associations after multiple testing adjustment. 

Just to take a look how the differential network could look like, we plot the 
differential network based on non-adjusted p-values. Note that this approach is 
statistically not correct!

```{r diffnet 2}
plot(diffnet_amgut, adjusted = FALSE,
     mar = c(2, 2, 5, 15), legendPos = c(1.2,1.2),
     legendArgs = list(bty = "n"),
     legendGroupnames = c("yes", "no"),
     legendTitle = "Correlations:")
```


#### Network comparison using createAssoPerm()

This time, the permutation association matrices are generated using 
`createAssoPerm()` and then passed to `netCompare()`. 

The output should be written to a variable because `createAssoPerm()` generally 
returns the matrix with permuted group labels.

```{r createAssoPerm 1, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
permGroupMat <- createAssoPerm(props_amgut, nPerm = 100, 
                               computeAsso = TRUE,
                               fileStoreAssoPerm = "assoPerm",
                               storeCountsPerm = TRUE, 
                               append = FALSE, seed = 123456)
```

Let's take a look at the permuted group labels. To interpret the group labels 
correctly, it is important to know, that within `netConstruct()`, the data 
set is divided into two matrices belonging to the two groups. For the permutation
tests, the two matrices are combined by rows and for each permutation, the 
samples are reassigned to one of the two groups while keeping the matching design
for matched data.

In our case, the `permGroupMat` matrix consists of 100 rows (`nPerm = 100`) and 
150 columns (our sample size). The first 50 columns belong to the first group 
(group "yes" in our case) and columns 51 to 150 belong to the second group. 

Since each two samples of group 2 are matched to one sample of group 1, we number
the group label matrix accordingly. Now, we can see that the matching design is 
kept: Since sample 3 is assigned to group 1, samples 1 and 2 have to be assigned 
to group 2 and so on (entries [1,1] and [1,51:52] of `permGroupMat`).

```{r createAssoPerm 2}
seq1 <- seq(1,150, by = 3)
seq2 <- seq(1:150)[!seq(1:150)%in%seq1]

colnames(permGroupMat) <- c(seq1, seq2)

permGroupMat[1:5, 1:10]
permGroupMat[1:5, 51:71]
```

As before, the stored permutation association matrices are passed to 
`netCompare()`.

```{r createAssoPerm 3}
comp_amgut2 <- netCompare(props_amgut, permTest = TRUE, nPerm = 100, 
                          fileLoadAssoPerm = "assoPerm",
                          seed = 123456)

# Are the network properties equal?
all.equal(comp_amgut_orig$properties, comp_amgut2$properties)
```

Using the `fm.open` function, we take a look at the stored matrices themselves.

```{r createAssoPerm 4}
# Open stored files and check whether they are equal
assoPerm1 <- filematrix::fm.open(filenamebase = "assoPerm_comp" , readonly = TRUE)
assoPerm2 <- filematrix::fm.open(filenamebase = "assoPerm" , readonly = TRUE)

identical(as.matrix(assoPerm1), as.matrix(assoPerm2))

dim(as.matrix(assoPerm1))
dim(as.matrix(assoPerm2))

# Close files 
filematrix::close(assoPerm1)
filematrix::close(assoPerm2)
```

#### Block-wise execution

Due to limited resources, it might be meaningful to estimate the associations 
in blocks, that is, for a subset of permutations instead of all permutations at 
once. We'll now see how to perform such a block-wise network comparison using 
NetCoMi's functions.
Note that in this approach, the external file is extended in each iteration, 
which is why it is not parallelizable.

In the first step, `createAssoPerm` is used to generate the matrix with 
permuted group labels (for all permutations!). Hence, we set the `computeAsso` 
parameter to `FALSE`.


```{r blocks 1}
permGroupMat <- createAssoPerm(props_amgut, nPerm = 100, 
                               computeAsso = FALSE, seed = 123456)

```
We now compute the association matrices in blocks of 10 permutations in each loop.
Note: The `nPerm` argument must be set to the block size.

The external file (containing the association matrices) must be extended in each loop,
except for the first iteration, where the file is created. Thus, `append` is set 
to `TRUE` for `i >=2 `.

```{r blocks 2}
nPerm_all <- 100
blocksize <- 20
repetitions <- nPerm_all / blocksize

for(i in 1:repetitions){
  print(i)
  if(i == 1){
    # Create a new file in the first run
    tmp <- createAssoPerm(props_amgut, nPerm = blocksize, 
                          permGroupMat = permGroupMat[(i-1) * blocksize + 1:blocksize, ],
                          computeAsso = TRUE,
                          fileStoreAssoPerm = "assoPerm",
                          storeCountsPerm = FALSE, append = FALSE)
  } else{
    tmp <- createAssoPerm(props_amgut, nPerm = blocksize, 
                          permGroupMat = permGroupMat[(i-1) * blocksize + 1:blocksize, ],
                          computeAsso = TRUE,
                          fileStoreAssoPerm = "assoPerm",
                          storeCountsPerm = FALSE, append = TRUE)
  }
  
}
```

The stored file, which now contains the associations of all 100 permutations, 
can be passed to `netCompare()` as before. 

```{r blocks 3}
comp_amgut3 <- netCompare(props_amgut, permTest = TRUE, nPerm = 100, 
                          storeAssoPerm = TRUE,
                          fileLoadAssoPerm = "assoPerm",
                          storeCountsPerm = FALSE, seed = 123456)

# Are the network properties equal to the first comparison?
all.equal(comp_amgut_orig$properties, comp_amgut3$properties)

# Open stored files and check whether they are equal
assoPerm1 <- fm.open(filenamebase = "assoPerm_comp" , readonly = TRUE)
assoPerm3 <- fm.open(filenamebase = "assoPerm" , readonly = TRUE)

all.equal(as.matrix(assoPerm1), as.matrix(assoPerm3))

dim(as.matrix(assoPerm1))
dim(as.matrix(assoPerm3))

# Close files 
close(assoPerm1)
close(assoPerm3)
```

#### Block-wise execution (executable in parallel)

If the blocks should be computed in parallel, extending the `"assoPerm"` file 
in each iteration would not work. To be able to run the blocks in parallel, 
we have to create a separate file in each iteration and combine them at the end.

```{r blocks 4}
# Create the matrix with permuted group labels (as before)
permGroupMat <- createAssoPerm(props_amgut, nPerm = 100, computeAsso = FALSE,
                               seed = 123456)


nPerm_all <- 100
blocksize <- 20
repetitions <- nPerm_all / blocksize

# This code can easily be parallelized:
for(i in 1:repetitions){
  tmp <- createAssoPerm(props_amgut, nPerm = blocksize, 
                        permGroupMat = permGroupMat[(i-1) * blocksize + 1:blocksize, ],
                        computeAsso = TRUE,
                        fileStoreAssoPerm = paste0("assoPerm", i),
                        storeCountsPerm = FALSE, append = FALSE)
  
}

# Combine the matrices and store them into a new file (because netCompare() 
# needs an external file)
assoPerm_all <- NULL

for(i in 1:repetitions){
  
  assoPerm_tmp <- fm.open(filenamebase = paste0("assoPerm", i) , readonly = TRUE)
  
  assoPerm_all <- rbind(assoPerm_all, as.matrix(assoPerm_tmp))
  
  close(assoPerm_tmp)
}

dim(assoPerm_all)

# Combine the permutation association matrices
fm.create.from.matrix(filenamebase = "assoPerm", mat = assoPerm_all)
```

As last step, we pass the file containing the combined matrix to `netCompare()`.

```{r blocks 5}
comp_amgut4 <- netCompare(props_amgut, permTest = TRUE, nPerm = 100, 
                          fileLoadAssoPerm = "assoPerm",
                          storeCountsPerm = FALSE, seed = 123456)

# Are the network properties equal to those of the first comparison?
all.equal(comp_amgut_orig$properties, comp_amgut4$properties)

# Open stored files and check whether they are equal
assoPerm1 <- fm.open(filenamebase = "assoPerm_comp" , readonly = TRUE)
assoPerm4 <- fm.open(filenamebase = "assoPerm" , readonly = TRUE)
identical(as.matrix(assoPerm1), as.matrix(assoPerm4))

dim(as.matrix(assoPerm1))
dim(as.matrix(assoPerm4))

# Close files 
close(assoPerm1)
close(assoPerm4)
```
